# Governance Framework for TechFlow Solutions RPA Platform

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Automation Lead**: platform owner, approves major design/scale decisions.
- **Developer**: writes automation code, unit tests, and documentation.
- **Approver / Release Manager**: reviews PRs for security and compliance before merging.
- **Auditor / Compliance Officer**: reviews logs, access records, and retention policies.

## Repository & Documentation Standards
- Every repo must include:
  - `README.md` with purpose, run instructions, and environment variables
  - `docs/` with architecture, runbooks, and compliance notes
  - Inline docstrings (Google or NumPy style) and typed Python (type hints)
  - Structured logging convention (JSON) and an example `log_schema.md` in docs
- Semantic versioning for releases: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Use `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` and a GitHub Actions workflow for CI.

## Change Management & Branching
- Branching model: `main` (protected) ← `release/*` ← `develop` ← feature branches `feat/xxx`
- Pull Request requirements:
  - At least one code review by a peer
  - Automated tests pass (unit tests, lint, security scan)
  - Security review for infra/secret changes
- Use signed commits for release tags.

## Risk Management
- **Rollback plan**: automated rollback via deployment manifest stored in Git (previous tag).
- **Alerting on failures**: high priority incidents trigger paging and open an incident ticket.
- **Error audit trail**: all failures logged with job id and commit hash; logs are retained for X days per policy.
- **Secrets management**: do not store secrets in repo. Use secret stores (HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Secrets).

## GitHub Workflows & Automation
- CI: run tests, linters, dependency checks, and SCA (Software Composition Analysis).
- CD: gated deployments for production (manual approval step).
- Scheduled security scans and dependency updates (dependabot).
