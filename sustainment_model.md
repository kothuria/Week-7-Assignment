# Sustainment Model for TechFlow Solutions RPA Platform

## Overview
This sustainment model describes how TechFlow Solutions will keep Python-based, code-first automations healthy, observable, and performant as scale increases from single-user scripts to multi-user, production-level automations.

Key focus areas:
- Monitoring (logs, uptime, errors)
- Failure handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization across scripts and environments
- Scaling infrastructure and reliability

(Authoritative guidance and frameworks that informed this model: NIST Cybersecurity Framework; GDPR requirements for automated processing). 

## Monitoring Strategy
1. **Structured Logging**: All bots write structured JSON logs with fields: `timestamp`, `bot_id`, `job_id`, `level`, `message`, `duration_ms`, `status`, `error` (if any), `meta`.
2. **Log Aggregation**: Use a centralized log store (ELK / OpenSearch / Cloud Logging). For this assignment we provide a simple local simulation (`scripts/generate_synthetic_logs.py`) that writes JSON logs to `/logs`.
3. **Metric Collection**: Capture metrics such as job count, error rate, average execution time, and resource usage. Export these as Prometheus metrics in production (or push to a metrics backend).
4. **Alerting & SLOs**: Define SLOs (e.g., <1% error rate, 99.5% uptime) and alerts (PagerDuty, Teams, Slack) when thresholds exceed limits.
5. **Synthetic Transactions / Canary Runs**: Schedule lightweight health-check jobs that validate core dependencies and environment.

## Failure Handling
- **Retry with backoff** for transient failures (network/API timeouts).
- **Circuit Breaker** around unreliable external services.
- **Idempotency**: design bots to be idempotent when possible (use job ids / dedupe tokens).
- **Dead-letter queue**: failed payloads moved to a DLQ for human review.
- **Escalation policy**: automated retry → notify owner → create incident ticket if unresolved.

## Performance Optimization
- Batch I/O where possible.
- Use async IO for network-bound tasks.
- Profiling pipeline: `cProfile` to locate hotspots, optimize heavy functions.
- Dependency caching and virtual environments per environment.
- Use lightweight containers for isolation; scale horizontally via orchestrator (Kubernetes, AWS ECS).

## Scaling Strategy
- Development → Staging → Production environments with separate config and secrets.
- Containerize bots and use deployment manifests (Helm / Kubernetes).
- Horizontal scaling by instance count + autoscaling based on queue length / CPU.
- Centralized job scheduler (e.g., Celery/RabbitMQ, Kubernetes CronJobs, or managed Workflows).

## Simulated Monitoring Example
See `scripts/generate_synthetic_logs.py` to create sample logs and `scripts/monitoring_demo.py` to compute simple metrics (error rate, avg duration) and flag alerts.
